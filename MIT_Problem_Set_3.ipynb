        "\n",
        "In object-oriented programming, an **abstract class** is a blueprint for other classes. It defines shared attributes and method signatures and leaves the actual implementation of certain methods to its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like a contract:\n",
        "\n",
        "> “Any class that inherits from me must implement these specific methods.”\n",
        "\n",
        "You cannot create an instance of an abstract class directly. It exists to enforce structure, provide shared logic, and guide consistent subclass design.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why Use Abstract Classes?\n",
        "Abstract classes are powerful in simulations like this one because they let you:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Define shared behavior** (e.g., how to check if a position is in the room)\n",
        "* **Enforce required methods** (e.g., update_position_and_clean)\n",
        "* **Avoid duplicate code** while still allowing variety (e.g., different robot movement strategies)\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Every Robot has a position, direction, speed, and cleaning capacity.\n",
        "* But not every robot moves the same way, so the movement logic is left abstract.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### In This Project\n",
        "\n",
        "* `RectangularRoom` provides the shared structure for room types but doesn't decide whether a room has furniture.\n",
        "* `Robot` ensures all robots track position and clean tiles, but lets subclasses like `StandardRobot` or `FaultyRobot` define how they move and clean.\n",
        "\n",
        "This design made the project modular and extensible which is ideal for comparing different movement and cleaning strategies without rewriting shared code."
